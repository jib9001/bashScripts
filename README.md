# bashScripts
This repo contains the various bash scripts that I have/will written/write that I create to make my life easier
Feel free to use them if you want, but I won't provide support

Since I wrote these for personal use, there's almost no error checking, so I'll have to write instructions on what each one does and how to avoid errors, but I'll do that later

To use/install any of them:
Download the script you want to use
Open a terminal in the same directory and run: chmod +x <script name>
Then place the script in the root/usr/bin directory
Finally, type the name of the script into the terminal and it will execute
